# banking_churn
This project predicts bank customer churn using features like demographics, account details, and activity. Data was analyzed, preprocessed, and modeled with Decision Tree, SVC, AdaBoost, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. Model accuracies were compared to identify patterns and help the bank target at-risk customers for retention.
